# Getting Started with React Router v7

React Router v7 brings exciting new features and improvements that make building modern web applications easier than ever. In this post, we'll explore the key changes and how to get started.

<Callout type='success' title='Major Release'>
  React Router v7 is a major release with breaking changes but offers
  significant improvements in developer experience and performance.
</Callout>

## What's New in v7?

React Router v7 introduces several major improvements:

### 1. File-Based Routing

One of the biggest changes is the introduction of file-based routing, similar to Next.js:

```tsx
// app/routes/about.tsx
export default function About() {
  return <div>About Page</div>;
}
```

### 2. Built-in Data Loading

The new data loading pattern simplifies server-side data fetching:

```tsx
export async function loader({ params }: Route.LoaderArgs) {
  const data = await fetchData(params.id);
  return { data };
}

export default function Component({ loaderData }: Route.ComponentProps) {
  return <div>{loaderData.data}</div>;
}
```

### 3. Improved Type Safety

Better TypeScript integration with automatic type generation:

```tsx
import type { Route } from './+types/about';

export function meta({}: Route.MetaArgs) {
  return [{ title: 'About Page' }];
}
```
